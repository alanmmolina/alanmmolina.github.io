Building a modular data engineering stack requires more than just choosing the right tools—it also means keeping everything organized, reproducible, and easy to manage. Since [[00. Concept & Motivation|Lakeground]] will be made up of multiple independent components, I need a way to handle Python environments in a way that’s both flexible and efficient. That’s where [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) comes in.

## Why `uv`?  
Python has no shortage of package and environment managers, but `uv` brings something fresh to the table. Developed by the same folks behind `Ruff`, `uv` is a modern, high-performance tool built with Rust. It’s designed to be **fast**, **lightweight**, and **developer-friendly**, addressing some of the pain points of traditional tools like `pip`, `venv`, and `virtualenv`.

But what really makes `uv` a perfect fit for [[00. Concept & Motivation|Lakeground]] is its **workspace** feature.

### `uv` workspaces
Since [[00. Concept & Motivation|Lakeground]] is structured as a monorepo, with each component functioning as an independent module, I need an environment management solution that respects that modularity. `uv`’s workspaces allow multiple projects to coexist under a single umbrella while maintaining their own dependencies and configurations. This means I can develop and test each part of the stack independently, without worrying about dependency conflicts.

The concept of workspaces in `uv` draws direct inspiration from **Cargo Workspaces** in the Rust programming language. Cargo's workspace feature allows developers to manage multiple interdependent packages in a single repository while maintaining separate, but compatible, dependency trees for each package. This modular approach promotes efficient development, clear dependency management, and streamlined collaboration.

Similarly, `uv` workspaces take the same principles and apply them to Python environments. By mimicking this well-established pattern from Rust, `uv` provides a powerful solution to the challenges of managing dependencies across multiple Python projects. Just like Cargo ensures that each crate within a workspace is isolated but can still share dependencies, `uv` allows me to manage each component of [[00. Concept & Motivation|Lakeground]] independently while ensuring that shared libraries are consistently maintained.
