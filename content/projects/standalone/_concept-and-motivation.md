> Complete ideas, built small by design.

These are end-to-end, self-contained projects—each one designed to explore a specific tool, workflow, or question. No sprawling architectures or infinite TODOs. Just tightly scoped builds that go from idea to implementation.

Each one stands on its own two feet—just enough code to tell a story.
