Hey there! :)

I’m **Alan Molina**, a **Data Engineer** passionate about crafting elegant solutions for messy data problems. With over 5 years of experience, I’ve had plenty of opportunities to navigate the world of data pipelines, mostly solving puzzles that come with big (and sometimes chaotic) datasets. I hold a degree in **Control and Automation Engineering**, and while I once dabbled in robotics, I eventually found my true calling in data. 

When I’m not building data pipelines or writing about them, I’m usually creating (sometimes questionably useful) things with my 3D printer. I’m a big fan of movies, especially heist films and time travel stories, and I also love games. But what truly matters most to me is sharing life’s moments with my lovely wife, who’s not only my partner but has been my best friend since high school.

At heart, I’m just a curious mind with a love for learning and a knack for sharing what I’ve learned along the way. That’s exactly what this site is all about: breaking down complex topics, sharing practical tips, and showing how I learn best — by jumping in and figuring things out.
